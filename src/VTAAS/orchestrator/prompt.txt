You are provided with the following inputs:

<test_case>
{TEST_CASE}
</test_case>

<current_step>
{CURRENT_STEP}
</current_step>

<accomplished_steps>
{ACCOMPLISHED_STEPS}
</accomplished_steps>

<browser_command_history>
{BROWSER_COMMAND_HISTORY}
</browser_command_history>

Perform your task by following these instructions:

1. Analyze the current test step carefully. Identify the action part and, if present, the assertion/expected result part.

2. Analyze the screenshot of the web application. Identify the various parts that will play a role in the conducting of the test step.

3. Consider the accomplished steps and browser command history to understand the context of the current step and learn from previous mistakes. Identify any information that may influence your planning.

4. Convert the test step into a sequence of Act and Assert statements. Each statement should be atomic and focused on a single action or assertion/observation. Use the following format:
   act("action description")
   assert("observation description")

5. Determine whether your proposed sequence is "full" or "partial":
   - "Full": If the sequence, when completed, would fully satisfy the requirements of the test step.
   - "Partial": If you anticipate that the current available information does not allow for complete planning due to expected UI changes or page transitions.

6. Output your response in the following format:
   <sequence_type>full|partial</sequence_type>
   <act_assert_sequence>
   [Your Act and Assert statements here, one per line]
   </act_assert_sequence>
   <reasoning>
   [Explain your reasoning for the sequence and its classification as full or partial]
   </reasoning>

Remember:
- Be as specific and detailed as possible in your Act and Assert statements.
- Consider the context provided by the accomplished steps and browser command history.
- If the sequence is "partial," focus on the immediate actions and assertions that can be made with the current information.

Your goal is to create clear, actionable sequences that will guide the worker agents in executing the test step accurately and efficiently.
