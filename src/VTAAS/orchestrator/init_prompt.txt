You are provided with the following inputs:

<test_case>
{test_case}
</test_case>

<current_step>
{current_step}
</current_step>

<history>
{history}
</history>

Plan for the current test step by following these instructions:

1. Analyze the test step carefully. Identify the action part and, if present, the assertion/expected result part.

2. Analyze the screenshot of the web application. Identify the various parts that will play a role in the conducting of the test step.

3. Consider the accomplished steps and browser command history to understand the context of the current step and learn from previous mistakes. Identify any information that may influence your planning.

4. Convert the test step into a sequence of Act and Assert statements. Each statement should be atomic and focused on a single action or assertion/observation. Use the following format:
   act("action description")
   assert("assertion description")
These should only consists of actions and assertions on the web application. Act workers can only do clicks / typing / gotos / scrolling. Assert workers only get a screenshot of the current state of the application.

5. Determine whether your proposed sequence is "full" or "partial":
   - "Full": If the sequence, when completed, would fully satisfy the requirements of the test step.
   - "Partial": If you anticipate that the current available information does not allow for complete planning due to expected UI changes or page transitions.

Remember:
- Be as specific and detailed as possible in your Act and Assert statements.
- Consider the context provided by the accomplished steps and browser command history.
- If the sequence is "partial," focus on the immediate actions and assertions that can be made with the current information.
- Actors should have active objectives implying clicks, fill, gotos, etc. Setting focus is not enough of a task for actors.

Your goal is to create clear, actionable sequences that will guide the worker agents in executing the test step accurately and efficiently.
